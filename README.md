This project is a simple console-based quiz application developed in Java to demonstrate fundamental concepts such as object-oriented programming, user input handling, conditionals, and loops. The application is entirely text-based and runs in the terminal. It presents the user with multiple-choice questions (MCQs), each having four options (A, B, C, D). The user selects an answer by typing the corresponding letter, and the program checks if the answer is correct. Feedback is given after each question, and a final score is displayed at the end of the quiz. The code is organized using two main components: a QuizQuestion class that encapsulates the question, options, and correct answer, and a QuizApp class that contains the main method responsible for running the quiz flow. The questions are stored in an array of QuizQuestion objects, making it easy to add or modify questions. This project is ideal for beginners who want to practice core Java features in a practical way. It runs on any Java-supported platform and does not require any external libraries. To run the project, simply compile the Java file using javac and run the compiled class with java. This quiz app can be easily extended to include more advanced features such as category selection, time limits, scoring systems, difficulty levels, and even graphical interfaces using JavaFX or Swing. It provides a strong foundation for understanding how console-based applications work and is a good starting point for anyone learning Java.
